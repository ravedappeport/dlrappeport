# Overview

This is a mono repo responsible for source control of my personal website, [dlrappeport.com](www.dlrappeport.com). `/notebooks/` is a directory where I store jupyter notebooks related to blog posts and `/personal-site/` is a directory that stores html and markdown files that are copies of what is sync'd to s3 to materialize the personal site. For those who are curious, I've built the personal site using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and a personally modified version of the [Anubis Theme)(https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-anubis/).

Cheers,
Dave
