## Background
Sometimes life finds a way of telling you to sit down and write a blog post. Recently, newsletters, twitter feeds, and bloggers that I follow have all been talking about the same things. How do we [build data teams at startups](https://erikbern.com/2021/07/07/the-data-team-a-short-story.html)? What is the [modern data experience](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-modern-data-experience#footnote-1)? What do [data people call themselves and how do they specialize](https://blog.getdbt.com/we-the-purple-people/)? What is the [future of the data platform](https://martinfowler.com/articles/data-monolith-to-mesh.html)?

I have also been having conversations within my personal network of friends and friends of friends at startups and offering my own perspective of how to build successful data functions. To be honest, a lot of the time I simply point people to some of the articles and authors linked above. What unique perspective I do have is informed by my experience leading data functions at multiple points of the company lifecycle from series B startup to acquisition. Along the way, I've learned quite a few valuable lessons and in channelling the spirit of all the armchair philosophers who have come before me, here are my maxims for creating successful data functions.
