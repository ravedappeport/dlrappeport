## Context

I have [previously written](/career-change/) about why I made the decision to become a product manager. Now after more than a year in the role, something that I still find intriguing about my new career is how difficult it is to explain what product management is to someone who has never been a PM. To be honest, its even a difficult topic for those of us who have the job to sometimes explain to ourselves because it is my firm belief that no two product management jobs are ever the same. <FILL IN LATER>

## The What the Why and the Why Now

</p>

I attribute the title of this section to a friend and mentor, Parilee Wang. Before ever becoming a PM, Parilee had told me that the primary responsibilities of a good product manager are *owning* the "What", "Why", and the "Why Now". The "What" is short for "what is the customer problem that the business is trying to solve". The "Why" is short for "why is this problem something the business should solve". Finally, the "Why Now" is short for "why should the business solve this problem now as opposed to focusing on something else". Together these three questions represent a framework for understanding and prioritizing the customer problems that a business should work towards solving. 

<br>

What does it mean to *own* these questions? In my experience this is more complicated than simply having an answer for each. Additionally, *ownership* does not mean that you as a product manager have unilateral decision making authority to answer these questions in a vacuum. I've come to believe that *owning* the "What", the "Why", and the "Why Now" means that you, as a product manager, are the person responsible for making sure the company as a collective whole has an answer of each of these questions. I think a common misconception of product management is that you are responsible for "coming up" with answers but the truth is that you're actually responsible for helping the business to find them. The difference is subtle but important. More often than not, the answer to any of these three questions can be answered from within the business and the job of a PM is to make sure you're asking the right questions and building consensus. In the instances where answers to the questions cannot be easily found within the company, a PM should be helping to lead the search rather than going on a solo mission to find answers. Taken together this means somewhat paradoxically that even though a good product manager *owns* the answers to the "What", the "Why", and the "Why Now", as a rule of thumb, a product manager should always be asking more questions about the "What", the "Why", and the "Why Now" than he or she is answering. 

## Decisions and Deadlines

The "What", the "Why", and the "Why Now" is my framework for understanding how to prioritize the importance of customer and business problems but the job of a product manager doesn't end here. PMs are also *responsible* for "execution" i.e. helping to create and bring solutions to customer problems to market. Again, *responsible* does not mean that PMs are the only owns who make decisions and take action when bringing a product to market. This is probably a generous analogy but I think that this part of the PM job remit is similar to being the conductor of a symphony orchestra. And if you're wondering, ["Why do orchestras need conductors?"](https://www.npr.org/sections/deceptivecadence/2012/11/27/165677915/do-orchestras-really-need-conductors), please bear with me.

As a PM, you do not take a hands-on role in bringing a product to market. Instead, the best course of action is to take an incredibly active role in *conducting* (see what I did there) efforts across teams and making sure that all teams are working in *harmony* (got ya again) to create the best possible solution for customers. But the conductor analogy goes further than this. I would argue that one of the most important qualities that a conductor brings to the orchestra is their initial idea of what a piece of music should sound like. Some people may think that conductors are strict authoritarians but I believe that the best conductors aren't completely beholden to their initial ideas of what a piece of music should sound like and instead use that initial idea as a launch pad to create something unique with the rest of the orchestra during performances and rehearsals. 

<br>

A good product manager must have an idea of what the product solution should "sound like" (so to speak) but equally important they need to be willing to iterate quickly and ask lots of questions of their own suggested solutions.
