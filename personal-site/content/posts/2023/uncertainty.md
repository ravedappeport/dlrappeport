## Context

I have [previously written](/career-change/) about why I made the decision to become a product manager. Now after more than a year in the role, something that I still find intriguing about my new career is how difficult it is to explain what product management is to someone who has never been a PM. To be honest, its even a difficult topic for those of us who have the job to sometimes explain to ourselves because it is my firm belief that no two product management jobs are ever the same. <FILL IN LATER>

## The What, The Why, and The Why Now

I attribute the title of this section to a friend and mentor or mine, Parilee Wang. Before ever becoming a PM, Parilee had told me that the primary responsibilities of a good product manager are owning "The What", "The Why", and "The Why Now". "The What" is short for "what is the customer problem that the business is trying to solve". "The Why" is short for "why is this problem something the business should solve". Finally, "The Why Now" is short for "why should the business solve this problem now as opposed to focusing on something else".
