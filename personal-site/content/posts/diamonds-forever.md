Time for a brief personal note. On January 29th 2021, I took the big leap and proposed to my girlfriend, Emma, at L'Auberge Resort in Sedona, Arizona. Thankfully, she said yes and we had an amazing weekend together. This photo below was taken by our photographer minutes after the proposal and captures a moment of pure bliss.

While I could definitely write more about the weekend we had, I am instead going to spend the rest of this post writing about something I had found better information about online.

So without further ado, I am going to write a post about diamonds. Specifically, I am going to write about buying diamond engagement rings online and digging deeply into how loose and lab diamonds are priced. If you are a data-minded individual who has saved up a pretty penny for an engagement ring, then this post is for you.
