## Intro

Happy New Year! It has been a while since my last post and truth be told, I have struggled thinking about what to write. Last year, really crystalized for me the importance of setting goals. Emma and I have been writing News Years resolutions now for almost four years and what I like most about the tradition is the personal accountability that comes from writing something down and saying not just to yourself but to those around you that this is my goal and I am going to work to achieve it. 

And perhaps because it is in my nature as someone who is usually always thinking of things in terms of metrics and KPIs, I like for a large number (but not all) of my goals to be quantifiable. They should also be challenging. I don't want to set the bar so low that I stumble over it easily. In fact, I don't mind having goals that don't work out so long as I truly give each my best shot. Quite often if I have chosen a good goal, I usually get more out of the attempt than I do from the end result. I believe the saying is "its the journey not the destination". Running a marathon was one such goal I set for myself last year.

## Philadelphia Marathon 2021

Growing up I was athletic, but I was never a runner. As a young man, I would run on a treadmill during a workout or go for the occassional jog and run the occasional 5k but I would never say that I was passionate about running. Weirdly, I have always been strangely fascinated by endurance athletes and runners, specifically those who ran marathons or longer distances, were the most interesting to me. The idea of running a marathon myself had always intrigued me, but I had never committed to the vision of myself training for and completing a 26.2 mile race.

That changed last year when in early 2021, I finally wrote "Running a Marathon" on my 2021 list of resolutions.

Thats me! On the right of the photo, struggling as I was approaching the final mile marker at mile 26. At the time this photo was captured, this was the longest distance I had ever run in my life.
