I live in New York City and currently work at Bread, a technology company that partners with e-commerce merchants and financial institutions to create pay over time solutions. This is my personal website and a place where I hope to keep myself intellectually honest about topics that interest me. At the moment, these topics fall broadly into the following:

- Data science
- Technology and startups
- Intersection of data analytics and professional sports
- Misc recipes
- Anything else I may feel like writing about in a particular month
